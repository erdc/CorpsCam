EXAMPLE PYTHON CODE:
Example code to batch download files can be found in the folder in this 
directory. Note, the python library is considerably less developed than the 
MATLAB library. However it can use the MinIO libraries which are powerful
and more apt to download CoastSnap Images since you do not need to know 
collection times prior.
